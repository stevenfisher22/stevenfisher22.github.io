        I really like movies. My brother Danny is a big film buff and got me into movies. I like lots of genres but I have a special fondness for horror and sci-fi.

        I started writing mini-reviews a few years ago on Twitter. It's amazing the creativity that can be wrought under the 140-character oppression. It's nearly perfect for movie reviews. Short and to the point.

        I moved my reviews to <a href="https://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a> a few years ago. It's a great community of fellow film lovers.
